2021-03-01 (March 1, 2021) First entry into CHANGELOG.
- I started the project: creating one web page with a text area and a button.
- I added a checkbox with functionality.
- I started the project as a way to type ISO233 characters without installing an extra keyboard.

    v1.00 2021-03-01
    Initial version. A textbox, a button and a checkbox.

    v1.01: 2021-03-01
    - allowed lowercase D with underdot to be typed. It was missing from the table.

    v1.02: 2021-03-01
    - ensure that checkbox does not go out of sync after page refresh.

2021-03-01 v1.10
- Switched to generating code using a template. Now a language can be added by adding two files, one
for the name of the language, and another for the substitutions that it supports. The developer then must
edit the shell script "generateWebPages.sh" and run it, and it should produce a suitable result.

At the same time the following orthographies have been added: French, Spanish or Portuguese, Maltese and Berber Latin alphabet.

2021-03-02 (no version change still v1.10)
- Add modern south arabian languages: Mehri and Soqotri
